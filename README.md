This is my first repository

A little bit about myself.

I am 23 years old and turn 24 in december 20th. I was in Israel last year when I turned 23 and appereantly I will be turning 24 in Israel again! I love Israel. It represents so much for my faith. I also love music. I love expressing my ideas through music. It is a powerful way to communicate. And I also love programming! I love mental challenges and this definetively challenges me every time. 

That's all for now.
